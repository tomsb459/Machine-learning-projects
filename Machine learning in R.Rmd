For the machine learning analysis below, I'm following Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell's book, "Hands-On Machine Learning with R" (book is available for free here: https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/index.html). Also following University of Oregon economist Grant McDermott's data science for economists course. See Prof McDermott's lecture notes: https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures#lecture-outline-and-quicklinks.

This R Markdown will be updated as I move forward with my own machine learning work using R. Feel free to reach me at tomstanleybecker459@gmail.com.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
